- Trained model saved as `model.pkl`
- Feature set saved as `feature_names.pkl` to ensure consistent inference

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, SHAP, MLflow

## 📊 Results
- Final model AUC: 0.87
- Churn rate segments identified with 70%+ precision
- Dashboard deployed for non-technical stakeholders
